Graphical User Interface (GUI): A GUI can make the tool more accessible to users who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces. You could use libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for this.

Automatic Quality Selection with Override Option: While your script downloads the highest quality video, you might add a feature that automatically selects a suitable quality based on internet speed or user preference, with the option to override this for a specific quality.

Bulk Download with Pause and Resume: Implement a feature to pause and resume downloads, especially useful for batch downloads.

Support for Subtitles and Closed Captions: Downloading videos with subtitles or closed captions, and offering options to select language, could be a valuable addition.

Configurable Settings through a Config File: Instead of hardcoding paths and settings, use a configuration file that users can edit according to their preferences.

Conversion to Other Formats: While your script supports MP3, adding support for other audio and video formats can be useful. This could include format conversion options post-download.

Integration with Cloud Storage Services: Directly upload the downloaded files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.

Download Speed Limiting: Allow users to set a download speed limit to avoid consuming all available bandwidth.

Download Scheduler: Implement a scheduler to set downloads to occur at a specific time, which can be useful for users with limited bandwidth during certain hours.

Command-line Arguments for Advanced Users: For users who prefer command-line, add argument parsing to control the script without interactive inputs.

Proxy Server Support: Add support for downloading through proxy servers, useful in regions where YouTube might be restricted.

Update Notification: Add a feature to notify users of updates to your script or to the dependencies like Pytube.

Logging Enhancements: Improve the logging system to include more detailed information and possibly different levels of logging (e.g., debug, info, error).

Playlist Customization: Offer options to download select videos from a playlist rather than the entire playlist.

Integration with a Database: For heavy users, integrating with a database to keep track of downloaded videos and their details could be useful.

Local Server for Remote Access: Implement a local server feature, allowing users to control the downloader remotely from a web interface within the same network.
